Labyrinth generator v. 2.0b (roguelike)

Added in 2.0b:
- dig now starts from half the lab size
- solve under construction

- preparing the solve() function - some notes below for further decision-making:
- recursion vs while True loop (until (x2, y2) reached on path list)
- visited - number (min number of visits each time)
- path - list of cells' coordinates (append good ones, pop bad ones)
- backtracking status - processing new branch or withdrawing from dead-end - needed True/False to determine if the crossroad cell should be marked as visited more than once (not if back from a dead-end and checking a new alternative - maybe manually putting the minus)
- backward tracking on the branch:
    - if min num of visits = 0 - it's a new path to check - append each visited cell to the path list, decrease by one the number of visits on the crossroad cell, invert backtracking status
    - if min num of visits = 1 - it's a dead-end - pop the whole branch from path list (one by one) until a crossroads with unvisited branches reached; then proceed the new path
    - apply path to hash_lab to display during print (,.:;)
